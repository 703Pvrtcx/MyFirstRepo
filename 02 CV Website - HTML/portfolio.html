        <h3>Security System Project: </h3>
        <p>Creating a Security System which has a Hex Keypad,
PIC Microcontroller, 2 Seven Segment Display, Resistors (Voltage Divider), Op-Amplifier, Multiplexer and PLC.
Keypad: If the user enters a correct password, the 7 segments displays 11 which simulate correct password. Then it activates the opening of a gate, else 00 is displayed to simulate incorrect password, then the gate state is left unchanged. Using counters, Timers, Shift Registers, Sourcing, Sinking, Cascading Timers, Data Conversions, Data Blocks, Functional Blocks, Normally Closed – Normally Opened Switched and Relays. Closely focused of safety precautions, emergency stops, safety mats. Evaluation: Research, Teamwork, Documentation, PLC Simulation and Understanding and application of ladder and FBD.

LCD Displays the current state in English (“Machine State: Soak”) and Two Green LEDs to simulate the change in states. The machine operates until all states are completed. If the machine is at last state and the lit is opened, emptied and loaded again, the machine starts the process again.</p>
